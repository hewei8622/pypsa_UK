## emisison per duration study

- a national UK system - current system (network and generation set)
  - it should be able to meet the demand without too much energy storage needed
  - could be able to use ES in a scenario to reduce emissions or minimize the use of coal 
    - so a case could be between coal-minimised vs. cost-minimized regarding the emission
- a future UK system with increased VRE 




- potential findings
  - LDES has lower emissions per kWh compared to battery even with much lower efficiency
  - the cost-efficiency trade-off over duration exists from whole system perspective  
    - sub-point - the power capacity of energy storage - as we only look into regional level, if larger power capacities could reduce the number of es plants - good for system operator  
  - role of energy storage varies when the system transit from fossil fuel dominate to VRE dominate
  - discussions
    - H2 plant - more like a storage or generator (generator makes more sense)
